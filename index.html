      <p><b>My brain!</b></p>
      <p>It feels like my head is too small for my brain. 
       I'm almost certain that the contents 
       inside my scull will spill out.</p>
      <p>The worst part right now is that I 
       don't know how to tidy up all the mess I've made.</p>

      <p>Ok, now I realised that Git bash is a little easier to use when committing. 
        The saving, stageing and committing is still very confusing. 
        Too many functions in VS code. I don't really have the time to experiment with code, 
        nor write in my log right now because I need to find out how to submit this to github.
        And understand how to use VS code.</p>

      <p>Got feedback on my assingnment today. Thankful for that, but it 
        gave me more to think about. I have changed the name of my folder so
        it follows the instruktione. At least I think it does.</p>
      <p>I spoke to Saskia today and realised that I hadn't checked out the 
         videos in Teams. So I could have saved myself some grief if I'd paid 
         attention. Well now I have checked them out and it made a lot 
         of stuff clearer.</p>      
      <p>I still have a lot of questions though. I would like to tidy up
        some of the mistakes I've made. I dont like having to see folders
        om my git hub that I won't use. Where is the delete button?</p>
      <p>I have to start writing down all the questions I have so I
        remember to add them to this journal. Now I don't remember them.
        And I have to start experimenting with some code so I don't forget
        all the things that I have already learned.
