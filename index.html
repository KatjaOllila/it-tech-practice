       <p><b>My brain!</b></p>
    <p>It feels like my head is too small for my brain. 
       I'm almost certain that the contents 
       inside my scull will spill out.</p>
    <p>The worst part right now is that I 
       don't know how to tidy up all the mess I've made.</p>
       <p>August 27</p>
       <p>Ok, now I realised that Git bash is a little easier to use when committing. 
        The saving, stageing and committing is still very confusing. 
        Too many functions in VS code. I don't really have the time to experiment with code, 
        nor write in my log right now because I need to find out how to submit this to github.
    And understand how to use VS code.</p>
